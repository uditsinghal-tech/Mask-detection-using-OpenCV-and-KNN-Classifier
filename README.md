This is a project with the aim to detect whether a person is wearing mask or not. haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file has been used here for the face detection from a video or photo of a person which would be captured by the help of openCV module. the training dataset for masked and unmasked face will be created and fed to a machine learning classifier KNN after performing normalisation and dimensionality reduction. After training the ML classifier, live mask prediiction can be done by again detecting face from a video or photo and then classifying it as "Mask" or "No Mask".
